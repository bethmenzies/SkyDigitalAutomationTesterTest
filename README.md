# SkyDigitalAutomationTesterTest
 Test for Automation Tester Role at Sky Digital

 Clone the project from the main branch.

 To run the tests -
 ```
 npm install
 ```
 Then you can run by using cypress open or cypress run. Do this by
 ```
 npm run cypress:open
 ```
 or
 ```
 npm run cypress:run
 ```
 respectively. 

The sign-in test will only run about 3 times before it takes you to the captcha page, and then it will fail.
